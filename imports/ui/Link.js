// Any non-lifecycle methods you add to a class using React do not have their this automatically bound, so if you ever try to reference an instance of your component in a method you created using something like this.setState  â€” it will not work unless you bind it. However, since the logout method does not make any use of this , you do not have to bind this to the instance of your component.

// Honestly, he probably did it out of habit as do I most of the time.

// A react component gets passed the props object to render dynamic content. The component cannot change
// the props object but it can change the state object.
// Component state is just an object like props. User interaction can change the state i.e state object is mutable
